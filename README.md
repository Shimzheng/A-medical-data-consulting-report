A consulting report for a client who has brought the data on arteries harvested from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

There are several important outcomes measured on the arteries; two are considered here, namely, radial artery (RA) medial calcification and internal thoracic artery (ITA) intimal abnormality.
The clients who carried out the study have thought about combining these two outcomes, which makes four groups (RA medial calcification: yes/no combined with ITA intimal abnormality yes/no).
The question they have is this: how are the explanatory variables age, gender, diabetes, ever smoked, PVD and CVD related to this variable? Can you predict which of the four groups someone will be in, based on these variables and these data? Is there more than one way of doing this? They are asking you to explore the associations and the potential to get a useful prediction.
